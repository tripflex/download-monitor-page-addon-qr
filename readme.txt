Add a QR Code below Download button for Mike Jolley's Download Monitor Page Addon

== Description ==

This Wordpress Plugin will add a QR Code in a Bootstrap 3 style panel right below the Download button that is created by Download Monitor Page Addon.  Right now the plugin only generates a 128x128 size QR Code, but hopefully in the future I can add support to define what size you want.

= Features =

* Display static 128x128 QR Code in Bootstrap 3 Panel
